You used the SageMaker Estimator API to deploy your SageMaker Model and Endpoint, and you used AWS Lambda and Step Functions to orchestrate your ML workflow. Using SageMaker Model Monitor, you instrumented and observed your Endpoint, and at the end of the project you built a visualization to help stakeholders understand the performance of the Endpoint over time. If you're up for it, you can even go further with these stretch goals:\n",

    "* Consider the test data generator we provided for you. Can we use it to create a \"dummy data\" generator, to simulate a continuous stream of input data? Or a big paralell load of data?\n",
